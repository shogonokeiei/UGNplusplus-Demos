UGN++: The Original Programming Language Making Quantum Technology a Reality
UGN++ shatters conventional quantum computing development, drastically cutting both cost and time by bringing quantum technology to life at the software level.

I'm Shogo Nakamoto, CEO of UGN++. This repository contains demonstration programs that showcase the incredible capabilities of UGN++.

Public Demo Program: ugn_program_new.ugn
This file is a demo program written in the UGN++ language. See how the following key features are implemented with remarkable simplicity and efficiency.

1. Qubit Operations
UGN++ allows you to describe the core of quantum computation—including qubit allocation, the application of fundamental quantum gates (e.g., Hadamard gate), and measurement—using intuitive syntax. This significantly simplifies the development of complex quantum algorithms.
(See: Execution Logs)

2. Integrated Self-Defense System (SDS)
UGN++ isn't just a quantum computation language; it integrates an autonomous Self-Defense System (SDS). Features vital for future cybersecurity, such as the automatic deployment of honeypots based on threat levels, are built directly into the program level.
(See: Execution Logs)

The Innovation of UGN++
Completely Original Language: We designed and built every component from scratch: the Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, Quantum Module, and SDS Module.

Ultimate Efficiency: Guided by the philosophy of "beauty in doing less," we relentlessly eliminated waste. This approach allowed us to "give form" to a language integrating quantum technology and SDS in just a few hours.

Challenging the Status Quo: While other organizations remain constrained by existing language frameworks even after decades, UGN++ takes a fundamentally different approach to accelerate the quantum revolution.


(UGN++ Demonstration Program (ugn_program_new.ugn) Code Explained)
This UGN++ program, initiated by the main command, showcases the seamless integration of UGN++'s core functionalities: its robust language foundation, advanced Self-Defense System (SDS), and native quantum computing capabilities.

1. Program Entry and Exit (the main command)
The program's lifecycle is managed by the main command, serving as the primary entry point.

commander main() {
    ugn_print("UGN++ Program Started!\n");
    // ... (other processes) ...
    ugn_print("UGN++ Program Finished!\n");
}
// Calls the main command as the program's starting point
main();
commander main(): This syntax defines the program's entry point in UGN++. The commander keyword indicates that main is treated as a special "command" distinct from ordinary functions, hinting at UGN++'s unique execution model.

ugn_print(): This appears to be UGN++'s built-in function for standard output (displaying text on the screen), used here to notify the user of the program's start and end.

main();: Calling main() at the end ensures the defined main command is executed, initiating the program flow.

2. Self-Defense System (SDS) Functionality
UGN++ demonstrates sophisticated autonomous security measures through its SDS.


    set_threat_level(6);
    assess_and_act();
set_threat_level(6);: This command sets the system's "threat level" to 6, illustrating UGN++'s ability to manage environmental states and risks numerically.

assess_and_act();: This command is designed to execute appropriate defensive actions based on the currently set threat level.


commander assess_and_act() {
    let current_threat = get_threat_level();
    ugn_print("Current threat level: " + current_threat + "\n");

    if (current_threat >= 7) {
        ugn_print("High threat detected! Activating final trap...\n");
        activate_final_trap();
    } else if (current_threat >= 5) {
        ugn_print("Moderate threat. Deploying honeypot \"alpha_trap_001\".\n");
        deploy_honeypot("alpha_trap_001");
    } else {
        ugn_print("Threat level is low. System is stable.\n");
    }
}
get_threat_level(): A function to retrieve the current threat level.

if-else if-else Structure: This standard conditional branching executes different actions based on the threat level:

current_threat >= 7: For high threat levels, it triggers activate_final_trap(), a final defensive measure.

current_threat >= 5: For moderate threat levels (which includes the current setting of 6), it executes deploy_honeypot("alpha_trap_001"). This command deploys a "honeypot"—a decoy system designed to attract, monitor, and analyze cyber attackers. This definitively shows UGN++'s capability to implement autonomous cyber defense at the program level.

This SDS feature highlights a revolutionary aspect of UGN++: its ability to integrate real-time security responses directly into the programming language, moving beyond a purely computational role.

3. Basic Programming Language Functionality Test
The program also demonstrates UGN++'s adherence to fundamental programming paradigms.


    ugn_print("--- Testing functions and variables ---\n");
    let num_a = 10;
    let num_b = 20;
    let total = calculate_sum(num_a, num_b);
    ugn_print("Sum of " + num_a + " and " + num_b + " is: " + total + "\n");

    ugn_print("--- Looping example ---\n");
    let counter = 0;
    while (counter < 3) {
        ugn_print("Loop iteration: " + counter + "\n");
        counter = counter + 1;
    }
let: This keyword is used for variable declaration (e.g., let num_a = 10;).

calculate_sum(a, b) Function:


fn calculate_sum(a, b) {
    let result = a + b;
    return result;
}
fn: The keyword for defining functions. This typical function definition accepts two arguments, a and b, calculates their sum, and returns the result.

while Loop:

while (counter < 3): This illustrates a standard loop structure that repeats a block of code as long as the condition remains true.

counter = counter + 1;: This demonstrates variable incrementation, confirming that basic arithmetic operations and variable manipulation are possible.

These sections prove that UGN++ possesses all the fundamental features essential for modern programming languages, including variables, functions, conditional statements (if/else), and loops (while).

4. Quantum Test Sequence Functionality
This is where UGN++ truly lives up to its name, showcasing its core ability to "realize quantum technology."


commander quantum_test_sequence() {
    ugn_print("Starting quantum test sequence...\n");

    let qbit_id_1 = allocate_qbit();
    let qbit_id_2 = allocate_qbit();

    ugn_print("Measuring qbit " + qbit_id_1 + ": ");
    let result_1 = measure_qbit(qbit_id_1);
    ugn_print(result_1 + "\n");

    ugn_print("Applying Hadamard to qbit " + qbit_id_2 + " and measuring: ");
    apply_hadamard(qbit_id_2);
    let result_2 = measure_qbit(qbit_id_2);
    ugn_print(result_2 + "\n");

    deallocate_qbit(qbit_id_1);
    deallocate_qbit(qbit_id_2);

    ugn_print("Quantum test sequence completed.\n");
}
quantum_test_sequence(): This command executes a series of operations related to quantum computing.

allocate_qbit(): A function to allocate (acquire) a new quantum bit. This demonstrates UGN++'s ability to dynamically manage quantum resources within the program.

measure_qbit(qbit_id): This function measures a specified qubit, returning its result (typically 0 or 1), indicating the collapse of a quantum state.

apply_hadamard(qbit_id): This function applies a Hadamard gate to a specified qubit. The Hadamard gate is the most fundamental quantum gate for creating superposition, proving UGN++ directly supports quantum gate operations.

deallocate_qbit(qbit_id): A function to release used qubits, demonstrating efficient management of quantum resources.

This section highlights the core of UGN++'s capability: its complete control over the qubit lifecycle (allocation, operation, measurement, deallocation), strongly suggesting that it can be used to write and execute complex quantum algorithms.
